Structured feedback assignment subplugin for Moodle
===================================================

The structured feedback assignment subplugin enables teachers to define
any number of criteria on which to provide individual feedback comments
for a student's assignment submission.

The configured 'criteria set' can then be saved for easy reuse in other
assignments. Given the appropriate permissions the teacher can also
choose to share their saved criteria sets with other teachers within
the same Moodle site.

Installation
------------

Installing from the Git repository (recommended if you installed Moodle
from Git):

Follow the instructions at
http://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Git_for_Administrators#Installing_a_contributed_extension_from_its_Git_repository,
e.g. for the Moodle 3.5.x code:

$ cd /path/to/your/moodle/
$ cd mod/assign/feedback/
$ git clone https://github.com/lucisgit/moodle-assignfeedback_structured.git structured
$ cd structured/
$ git checkout -b MOODLE_35_STABLE origin/MOODLE_35_STABLE
$ git branch -d master
$ cd /path/to/your/moodle/
$ echo /mod/assign/feedback/structured/ >> .git/info/exclude


Installing from a zip archive downloaded from
https://moodle.org/plugins/pluginversions.php?plugin=assignfeedback_structured:

1. Download and unzip the appropriate release for your version of
   Moodle.
2. Copy the extracted "structured" folder into your
   "/mod/assign/feedback/" subdirectory.

Whichever method you use to get the plugin code in place, the final
step is to visit your Site Administration > Notifications page in a
browser to invoke the installation script and make the necessary
database changes.


Updating Moodle
---------------

If you installed Moodle and the Structured feedback plugin from Git you
can run the following commands to update both (see
http://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Git_for_Administrators#Installing_a_contributed_extension_from_its_Git_repository):

$ cd /path/to/your/moodle/
$ git pull
$ cd mod/assign/feedback/structured/
$ git pull


If you installed from a zip archive you will need to repeat the
installation procedure using the appropriate zip file downloaded from
https://moodle.org/plugins/pluginversions.php?plugin=assignfeedback_structured
for your new Moodle version.
